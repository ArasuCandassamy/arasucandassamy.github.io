<!-- ## Teaching Experience

I have been involved in mathematics and physics education at various levels, focusing on helping students develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

### Current Positions

**Mathematics and Physics Oral Examiner** - _LycÃ©e Blaise Pascal, Orsay, France (May 2024 - Present)_
- Conduct oral examinations for MPSI (Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering Sciences) students in groups of three
- Select exercises and problems adapted to student levels
- Provide educational follow-up in collaboration with mathematics and physics teachers
- Focus on developing students' ability to present mathematical reasoning clearly and concisely

**Private Mathematics and Physics Tutor** - _Paris, France (2020-Present)_
- Provide private lessons in mathematics and physics for pre-baccalaureate students
- Prepare students for various exams and competitions:
  - Specialty baccalaureate examinations
  - Entrance exams for post-baccalaureate engineering schools
  - Academic support for struggling students
- Offer guidance and career counseling to help students make informed decisions about their academic paths

### Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching emphasizes:
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Building strong foundations rather than memorizing formulas
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Developing systematic approaches to tackle complex problems
- **Critical Thinking**: Encouraging students to question and analyze rather than accept blindly
- **Individual Adaptation**: Tailoring teaching methods to each student's learning style and pace

### Areas of Expertise

- **Mathematics**: Analysis, Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Optimization
- **Physics**: Classical Mechanics, Quantum Physics, Statistical Physics, Electromagnetism
- **Applied Mathematics**: Numerical Methods, Differential Equations, Mathematical Modeling
